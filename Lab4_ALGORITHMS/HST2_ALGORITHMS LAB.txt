HST2: ALGORITHMS LAB
Write a function my_sort which takes in a list of numbers (positive integers).

The function should return a list of sorted numbers such that odd numbers come first and even numbers come last.

For example:

my_sort([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]) => [1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 2, 4, 6, 8]

my_sort([1, 2]) => [1, 2]

my_sort([2, 1]) => [1, 2]

my_sort([3, 3, 4]) => [3, 3, 4]

my_sort([90, 45, 66]) => [45, 66, 90]
